1.BlockchainProject_Avalance_Fuji _C-Chain file ERC20, ERC751, ERC1155 standard tokens were created using Fuji tesnet. Metamask could not be distributed because there is no balance in my wallet. But the distribution process to the 'Remix' IDE has taken place.

2.Transfer_Balance_API file contains transfer, balance reading operations. To record them, PostgreSql database was created and log record was created.

3. MyERCTokenMint file is printed in ERC20, ERC751, ERC1155 standards. The API key was obtained from https://app.infura.io/. Since I don't have an existing token uri, it's written in code by default.
